MailOps Orchestrator - Project Handoff Document
Current Project State (September 5, 2025)
Working Components
1. CSV to CIDRS Converter

Status: Fully operational
Function: Converts new.csv to format required by enhanced generator
Key Logic: Duplicates domains based on subnet size for proper distribution
IP Filtering: Excludes .0, .1, .255 addresses

2. Enhanced Generator Integration

Status: Working correctly
Output: Non-enumerable hostnames with randomized prefixes
Example: xk9pw3mn-lon.mail1.example.com

3. Orchestrator Framework

Status: Menu system operational
Features: Debug logging, absolute paths, error recovery

Architecture Decisions Made
Data Management

Clean Slate: Each run clears and regenerates everything
Historical Archive: Previous runs stored for removal operations
Master File: infrastructure.json is single source of truth

IP Assignment Rules

One IP per domain (no shared IPs)
Maximum 30 IPs per domain
Never use .0, .1, or .255 addresses
CIDR ranges split evenly across domains on same line

DNS Structure

Infrastructure records use placeholder IP (5.135.7.116)
SPF includes full CIDR from original CSV
One DKIM key per parent domain
Tracking CNAME points to mailwizz.swiftiinbox.com

Naming Conventions

DKIM Selector: key1
Virtual-MTA: domain.com.c[third].[fourth]
Pool: MAILWIZZ-01-GI__[hostname]-[domain].p

Critical Implementation Notes
Removal Processing

REMOVE directives skip generation entirely
Removal data comes from previous_runs archive
Must remove OLD hostnames, not newly generated ones

File Persistence

input/new.csv persists (source of truth)
previous_runs/ persists (historical data)
Everything else cleared each run

Infrastructure.json Contents

Complete IP-to-domain mappings
All DNS and PTR records
DKIM keys and paths
PowerMTA configurations
Bounce/FBL server settings
Status tracking and audit trail

Next Implementation Phase
Script 1: DKIM Integration

Modify existing script for 2048-bit keys
Extract unique parent domains from hostnames.zone
Store public keys in infrastructure.json

Script 2: Infrastructure Generator

Parse hostnames.zone for IP mappings
Read CIDR from new.csv for SPF records
Generate comprehensive infrastructure.json
Create backward compatibility files

Script 3: PowerMTA Adapter

Read from infrastructure.json
Generate virtual-mta blocks with enhanced hostnames
Use correct naming convention

Script 4: DNS Generator

Create tab-separated file for Cloudflare
Include all record types in correct order
Separate PTR records for reverse DNS

Script 5: Removal Processor

Parse REMOVE directives from new.csv
Look up data in previous_runs
Generate deletion manifests

Testing Strategy
Phase 1: Small Scale

Test with /29 (6 usable IPs)
Verify all records generated correctly
Test removal operations

Phase 2: Medium Scale

Test with /24 (253 usable IPs)
Verify domain distribution
Check performance

Phase 3: Production Scale

Multiple /24 ranges
Hundreds of domains
Full removal/addition cycles

Known Issues and Solutions
Issue: Zone parser outputs empty files
Solution: Replace with comprehensive infrastructure generator
Issue: Predictable vs enhanced hostnames
Solution: Use enhanced hostnames everywhere
Issue: State management across runs
Solution: Archive previous runs, regenerate fresh
Success Metrics

All enhanced hostnames resolve correctly
DNS records match infrastructure.json
PowerMTA accepts generated configurations
Removals leave no orphaned records
Audit trail tracks all changes

Collaboration Points
User Provides

new.csv with CIDR and domain mappings
Removal directives
Infrastructure feedback

System Provides

Complete automation
Audit trails
Error recovery
Clean removal capability

Example Scenarios
Adding Infrastructure
/27 with 2 domains (30 usable IPs):
Input: 192.168.1.0/27,shop1.com,shop2.com
Result: 
- shop1.com gets IPs .2 through .16 (15 IPs)
- shop2.com gets IPs .17 through .31 (15 IPs)
- 30 enhanced hostnames generated
- 30 DNS A records created
- 30 PTR records created
- 2 DKIM key pairs generated
Removing Infrastructure
Input: REMOVE,olddomain.com
Process:
1. Skip olddomain.com in generation
2. Find in previous_runs/latest/infrastructure.json
3. Extract all records (DNS, PTR, files)
4. Generate removal commands
Result: Complete cleanup manifest
Final Notes
The system is designed for complete infrastructure lifecycle management. Every piece of data needed for creation, management, and removal is contained in infrastructure.json. The clean slate approach ensures no configuration drift, while historical archiving enables safe removal of existing infrastructure.

# MailOps Orchestrator - Development Updates

## September 5, 2025 - Major Integration Complete

### Accomplishments

#### Module Integration
- Successfully integrated DKIM generation from standalone script into orchestrator module system
- Fixed path calculation issues for modules running from subdirectories
- Resolved self-overwriting module problem that caused DKIM to fail after first run
- Removed all dependencies on numbered development scripts

#### Pipeline Functionality
- CSV to CIDRS conversion: ✓ Working
- Enhanced hostname generation: ✓ Working (254 records from /24)
- DKIM key generation: ✓ Working (2048-bit keys)
- Clean function: ✓ Fixed to handle directories properly

#### Code Quality Improvements
- Eliminated redundant numbered scripts
- Proper modularization of all components
- Comprehensive logging and debug capabilities
- Fixed orchestrator case handlers for proper module calls

### Technical Resolutions

#### Path Issues Fixed
- MODULE PROJECT_ROOT calculation corrected to reference parent directory
- All file paths now resolve correctly regardless of execution context

#### DKIM Module Stabilization
- Removed self-modification code that replaced working module with status checker
- Module now persists across multiple executions
- Proper error handling for missing prerequisites

### Known Issues
- Zone parser reports 0 IPs/domains despite processing records
- Options 4, 6, 7, 8 pending implementation

### Test Results
- Full pipeline test: PASSED
- 8 domains processed successfully
- DKIM keys generated and stored correctly
- DNS records created in proper format

## September 5, 2025 - Pipeline Integration Complete

### Fixed Issues
1. **Zone Parser Module**
   - Fixed regex pattern to match actual zone file format
   - Now correctly extracts 254 records from hostnames.zone
   - Creates proper parsed files for downstream processing

2. **Infrastructure Generator Module**
   - Created new module to generate master infrastructure.json
   - Correctly extracts DKIM public keys from nested JSON structure
   - Implements sequential IP distribution (32 IPs per domain)
   - Generates all required VMTA configurations

3. **Orchestrator Integration**
   - Fixed module calls for options 3 and 4
   - Maintained backward compatibility with existing functions
   - Preserved all working functionality

### Verified Working
- Complete pipeline from CSV input to infrastructure.json output
- 254 IP addresses properly distributed across 8 domains
- DKIM keys generated and tracked for all domains
- All data properly correlated in infrastructure.json

### Next Steps
- Implement PowerMTA configuration generator (Option 6)
- Create DNS update file generator (Option 7)
- Implement mailbox configuration (Option 8)
- Create MailWizz SQL generator (Option 9)
